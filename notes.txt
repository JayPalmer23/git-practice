In todays lesson I learn the importance of pushing, github, git, and more.
Git allows you to see your history, make commits, see who made changes and when they were made, and many other things!
With github, that is the place many of your files be pushed to. it allows others to see your coding, keep work safe, and work with others.
Futhermore, these thing will be important proffesionally.
