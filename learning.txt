In todays leson, im learning about the working Directory, Staging Area, and the Repository.
The Directory allows you to edit files, the git add moves to the staging area, and the git commit is stored in the Repository.
Overall, this helpful so we can see who made the changes and when they were made.
I am learning Git fundamentals.
Git tracks every change I make.
I can commit my work to save progress.
I just pushed my first repo to GitHub!
